      Lorem Ipsum... It isn't as easy as saying 'Wonder Woman 1984' is a good or
      bad movie. The pieces are there, and there are moments I adore, but it
      does come across as a bit of a mess, even though the action sequences are
      breathtaking. If you're a fan of the original film, you'll be more willing
      to take the ride, but for those more indifferent, it may be a bit of a
      blander sit. If you can and are planning to watch it, the theatrical
      experience is the way to go - there is nothing like seeing these stunning
      sets, fun action scenes and hearing Zimmer's jaw-dropping score like on
      the big screen. - Chris dos Santos... read the rest.
